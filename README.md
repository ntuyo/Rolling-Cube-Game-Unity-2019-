# Rolling-Cube-Game-Unity-2019-
A quick but fun cube navigation game, created Spring 2019  (Game Design and Development)

This game was my very first video game. I followed a simple Unity 3D tutorial on youtube to get the foundations of what the game might look like, and from there I created a unique game with a cube as the player and falling objects as the obstacles.
